                <h3>Project: JavaScript Calculator</h3>
                <p>This project was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used basic concepts of JavaScript fundamentals, functions and loops to achieve this iPhone like calculator.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project2">
                <h3>Project: Role Playing Game</h3>
                <p>I've crafted this practice project to immerse myself in fundamental programming concepts using JavaScript while building my very own Role Playing Game. I've honed my skills in manipulating arrays, strings, and objects, functions, navigating loops, and crafting effective if/else statements.</p>

                <h3>Project: Etch-a-Sketch</h3>
                <p>This project is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-a-Sketch. This project helped me leverage my DOM manipulation skills using JavaScript.</p>

            <div class="project4">
                <h3>Project: Rock Paper Scissors</h3>
                <p>This project contains a simple Rock Paper Scissors game implemented in JavaScript. The game allows a player to play against the computer in a series of rounds and displays the winner at the end.</p>

            <div class="project5">
                <h3>Project: Product Landing Page</h3>
                <p>The project was inspired by the layout of Apple's official iPhone website, though it's far from perfect primarily to practice using basic HTML and CSS, focusing mainly on different flexbox properties.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project6">
                <h3>Project: Quiz Page</h3>
                <p>In this project, I created a quiz webpage with a focus on accessibility tools like keyboard shortcuts, ARIA attributes, and design best practices. With this project, I aim to promote inclusivity and ensure that all users, including those with disabilities, can easily navigate and interact with the content.</p>
